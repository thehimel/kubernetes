# Kubernetes

- **K8s is an open-source system for automating DSM of containerized apps.**
  - DSM = deployment, scaling, and management.
- It groups containers that make up an app into logical units for easy management and discovery.
- Planet Scale: Designed on the same principles that allows Google to run billions of containers a week,
  K8s can scale without increasing your ops team.
- Never Outgrow: Whether testing locally or running a global enterprise, Kubernetes flexibility grows with you to
deliver your applications consistently and easily no matter how complex your need is.
- Run K8s Anywhere: Kubernetes is open source giving you the freedom to take advantage of on-premises, hybrid,
or public cloud infrastructure, letting you effortlessly move workloads to where it matters to you.
